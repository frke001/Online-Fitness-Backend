# OnlineFitness - Backend Application

This project is a Spring Boot application for the backend of the OnlineFitness system. It follows Spring principles and utilizes various packages such as services, controllers, models (DTO and entities), repositories, exceptions, advisors for global exception handling, and security configuration for Spring Security.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you can use your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or execute the JAR file generated by the build process. Ensure that you have configured the appropriate database connection properties in the `application.properties` file.

## Project Structure

- **controllers**: This package contains controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and generating responses.
- **services**: Services package contains business logic implementations and acts as an intermediary between controllers and repositories.
- **models**: Models package contains DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used for communication with clients, entities representing database entities, enums, and other model classes.
- **repositories**: Repository interfaces for database interaction using Spring Data JPA.
- **exceptions**: Custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios.
- **advises**: Global exception handlers using Spring's `@ControllerAdvice` annotation.
- **security**: Configuration classes for Spring Security, including security configurations, custom authentication provider, security filters, and security constants.

## Building Instructions

To build the project, use Maven or Gradle. For Maven, you can execute the `mvn clean package` command to generate the JAR file. For Gradle, use the `./gradlew build` command.

## Additional Information

For more information about Spring Boot and Spring Security, refer to the official documentation:
- [Spring Boot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html)
- [Spring Security Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/)

## Security Considerations

Ensure that proper security configurations are in place, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common security vulnerabilities such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing additional features such as caching, logging, monitoring, and scalability enhancements to improve the overall performance and reliability of the application.
